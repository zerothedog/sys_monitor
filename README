This project comprises of two parts, the system monitor that runs on your 
computer and the part that runs on your arduino. The system monitor 
communicates via UART over USB to the arduino which displays the received 
characters on the lcd 16x2 (HD44780 compatible) screen. This project should 
run on any linux based system, it was developed on Gentoo Linux. 

To configure the system monitor:
	
	open monitor/sys_monitor.c, and adjust

	TTY_FILE	The device file corresponding to your arduino
	TIME_DELAY 	The number of seconds between each probe
	NET_INTERFACE	The name of the in-use network interface
	BAUD		The baud rate (see termios.h for available options)

To configure the arduino:
	
	open arduino_display/arduino_display.c, and adjust

	BAUD			The baud rate (same as sys_monitor.c)
	F_CPU			The clock frequency of your MCU in Hz

	open arduino_display/lcd_driver.h, and adjust

	D0_PORT - D7_PORT	The port the corresponding data pins sits on 
	D0_PIN - D7_PIN		The pin number 
	EN_PORT			The port the enable pin sits on 
	EN_PIN			The pin number for the enable wire
	RW_PORT			The port the read/write pin sits on
	RW_PIN			The pin number for the read/write wire 
	RS_PORT			The port the register select pin sits on
	RS_PIN			The pin number for the register/select wire

	open arduino_display/Makefile, and adjust

	MCU			The name of your atmel micro-controller
	F_CPU			The clock frequency of your MCU in Hz
	PORT			The device file corresponding to your arduino
	PART			The name of your atmel micro-controller (caps)

To build the system monitor run
	make monitor/Makefile

To build the arduino program run
	make arduino_display/Makefile

Then upload the ihex file to the ardunio with 
	make arduino_display/upload

You can now start the system monitor with ./monitor/sys_monitor and after the
TIME_DELAY you specified in monitor/sys_monitor.c the results should appear 
on the lcd screen connected to your ardunio.
